Project Title: Compensation Structure & Pay Compression Analysis

Objective:
To analyze internal compensation data to evaluate pay distribution, identify pay compression risks, and assess compensation structure effectiveness across job families and departments.

Tools Used:
-Python
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Jupyter Notebook
-Excel (dashboard)

Key Analyses Performed:

Salary normalization and job family classification

Pay band design using P25, Median, and P75 benchmarks

Compa-ratio calculation to assess pay alignment

Identification of pay compression and inversion risks

Department-level compression and cost impact analysis

Key Insights:

Identified employees earning above job family P75 benchmarks

Detected concentration of pay compression in specific departments

Observed inconsistent pay band enforcement through compa-ratio dispersion

Estimated excess payroll cost due to compensation misalignment

Outcome:

This project demonstrates advanced compensation analytics, pay structure evaluation, and data-driven business insights relevant to financial analysis and workforce planning roles.
