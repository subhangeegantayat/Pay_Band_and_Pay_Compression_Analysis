Project Title: Pay Band & Pay Compression Analysis

Objective: To analyze internal compensation data to evaluate pay distribution, identify pay compression risks, and assess compensation structure effectiveness across job families and departments.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (dashboard)

Key Insights:
- Identified employees earning above job family P75 benchmarks
- Detected concentration of pay compression in specific departments
- Observed inconsistent pay band enforcement through compa-ratio dispersion
- Estimated excess payroll cost due to compensation misalignment

Outcome:
This project demonstrates advanced compensation analytics, pay structure evaluation, and data-driven business insights relevant to financial analysis and workforce planning roles.
